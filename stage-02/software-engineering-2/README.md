<p align="center"><strong>Module Overview</strong>
<br>
"To learn about topics that instil best practice into the studentsâ€™ software development activity. <br> To explore a range of commonly used programming paradigms. <br> To understand the benefit of using standardised design patterns."
</p>
<br/>

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

- Apply HCI and parallelism to construct more efficient and usable software.
- Illustrate the relative merits of various programming paradigms.
- Use appropriate programming paradigms to implement software that solves a given problem.
- Compare standard design patterns and explain why they are an important aspect of software engineering.

<h2>Assessments</h2>
The module is assessed via 100% coursework, across two elements:

<br>
<br>

<b> Set Exercises (30%) </b>
<br>
Assessment consists of: from a chosen scenario, analyse primary users and design user interfaces for a client-side mobile application. Then, carry out user testing on the designs, improve them, and then implement them within Java.

<b> Report (70%) </b>
<br>
Assessment consists of developing a client-side application to work in conjunction with the RESTful API created within [`COMP2001`](https://github.com/ORG4N/information-management-and-retrieval). Involved designing and implementing user interfaces as well as carrying out a usability evaluation.
