<p align="center"><strong>Module Overview</strong>
<br>
"Students learn about embedded microcontrollers, working with different processor architectures via a simulator, and develop embedded software. The use of hardware peripherals, interrupts, multi-tasking and defensive programming techniques will be explored. Students will optimize the execution time, energy consumption and memory size of their programs. The use of embedded programming within IoT applications is considered."

<br/>

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

- Write low-level embedded programs to safely interface/communicate with hardware peripherals.
- Apply code optimization in order to reduce the execution time of embedded programs.
- Apply and evaluate the impact of optimization techniques to general computer systems.
- Explain the role of embedded programming in IoT devices.
- Outline strategies for achieving parallelism, resource allocation and scheduling within an operating system.

<br>

<h2>Assessments</h2>
The module is assessed via 100% coursework, across two elements:

<br>
<br>

<b> Set Exercises (30%) </b>
<br>
Assessment consists of a code optimisation/speedup exercise.

<b> Report (70%) </b>
<br>
Assessment consists of programming a NUCELO board, in C, to meet certain requirements.
