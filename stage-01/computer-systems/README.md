<p align="center"><strong>Module Overview</strong>
<br>
"This module provides students with an underpinning knowledge of how computers work. Topics include 
low-level systems and representation of data, operating systems, and an introduction to subjects such 
as virtualisation, parallelism, state and communications. Students will learn how operating systems 
manage processes and scheduling, how memory management works and how software interacts with 
hardware."

<br/>

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

- Identify the functionality provided by an operating system and describe how each part works.
- Explain the way in which data and processes are represented at the machine level and interact 
with hardware.
- Outline strategies for achieving parallelism, resource allocation and scheduling within an 
operating system.
