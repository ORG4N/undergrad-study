<p align="center"><strong>Module Overview</strong>
<br>
"To familiarise students with the software development lifecycle. <br> To develop techniques to elicit requirements from abstract problems. <br> To expose students to both technical and non-technical skills required to complete a software engineering project."
</p>
<br/>

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

- Articulate the phases of the software development lifecycle.
- Define suitable functional and non-functional requirements that when implemented in software will solve a given problem.
- Identify and describe operational considerations of software, including the physical systems upon which they reside, cyber security and networking.
- Identify and discuss trade-offs in requirements analysis and the production of software versus operational considerations such as time and cost.

<h2>Assessments</h2>
The module is assessed via 80% coursework and 20% practice:

<details>
<summary><h3>Coursework</h3></summary>

<b> Interim Report </b>
<br>
Assessment consists of a report that represents all work carried out up until the half-way point of the project. This deliverable consists of 30% of the Coursework mark.

<b> Final Report </b>

<h2>About the Project</h2>

With a mission to satiate their customer’s appetite and provide a high quality dine-in environment Doki-Doki Delight envisions a future in which their small café can become a ‘safe space’ for their community. However, their unreliable and outdated paper-based reservation system has caused may inaccuracies and at times conflicts with their friendly motives. Implementing a web-based café management system will embellish Doki-Doki Delight’s mission and enable it to become modernised. 

Digitalisation of a management system will allow the primary stakeholders (managers and staff) to carry out their responsibilities effectively. The system will introduce benefits such as: the potential of accidental errors being limited and therefore an increase of accuracy; improved conveniency through a greater ease of access to the system – data can be easily amended or deleted; and finally, the Track and Trace implementations will provide a sense of security to the stakeholders – they can feel safe knowing that pandemic measures are in place. Overall, Doki-Doki Delight will be better equipped to serve their community.
