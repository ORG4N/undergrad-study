<p align="center"><strong>Module Overview</strong>
<br>
"To understand the concept and principles of virtualisation /softwarisation of computing and networking infrastructures in relation to the cloud computing and the future Internet. To deploy and analyse the performance of Internet services (such as web, video conferencing and video streaming) over SDN/NFV/Cloud platforms. To understand techniques for service provisioning, management, and performance improvement through automation, load balancing and resilience."

<br/>

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

-  Apply the concepts of virtualization and/or softwarisation in cloud computing and advanced networking (the future Internet).
-  Provision common services on virtual machines over SDN/NFV/Cloud platforms through automation or scripting
-  Test and analyse performance based on load balancing and cache, under different networking conditions.

<h2>Assessments</h2>
The module is assessed via 100% coursework, across two elements:

<br>
<br>

<b> Set Exercises (30%) </b>
<br>
Assessment consists of an experiment wherein an environment was created to test `load balancing`. Key technologies involved: `Docker`, `shell scripts`, `Nginx servers`.

<b> Report (70%) </b>
<br>
Assessment consists of an experiment wherein an `Adaptive Video Streaming` environment was craeted to investiage how network conditions affect video streaming quality.
