<p align="center"><strong>Module Overview</strong>
<br>
"To expose students to ways of thinking about computational problems different from mainstream imperative styles. To train students in alternative computing paradigms like declarative or functional programming To widen studentsâ€™ perspective on computing by introducing them to state-of-the-art novel technology like quantum computing or neural computing."
</p>
<br/>

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

- Critically evaluate the appropriateness of computing paradigms for a particular application.
- Apply the use of an alternative paradigm (e.g. functional programming) to produce a solution to a problem.
- Analyse a technology at the forefront of computational science
