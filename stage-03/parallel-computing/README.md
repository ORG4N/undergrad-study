<p align="center"><strong>Module Overview</strong>
<br>
"This module aims on giving students the practical understanding and skills needed to parallelize and
optimize real world programs on modern processors. Students will learn about state of the art high
performance computing (HPC) technologies, hardware computer architectures and parallel
programming models. This module will give students real world coding experience and hands on
project work."

<br/>

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

- Understand state of the art high performance computing technologies and parallel programming models
- Write performance efficient code to speedup programs on modern multi-core processors
- Design and implement performance efficient programs on GPUs.

<br>

<h2>Assessments</h2>
The module is assessed via 100% coursework, across two elements:

<br>
<br>

<b> Set Exercises (30%) </b>
<br>
Assessment consists of measuring `performance` of routines and solving `code optimization` exercises.

<b> Report (70%) </b>
<br>
Assessment consists of further `code optimization` exercises alongside `parallelization`.
