<p align="center"><strong>Module Overview</strong>
<br>
"To introduce the area of machine learning (ML) covering unsupervised, supervised and reinforcement learning from Bayesian perspectives. To give students the theory behind a range of learning techniques and how to apply these to build representations of data in systems that make decisions and predictions. To enable students to analyse real datasets and control real-time systems."

<br/>

<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>

-  Apply the concepts of unsupervised, supervised and reinforcement learning to tackle machine learning problems.
-  Implement and apply machine learning techniques to make decisions on real data sets and real-time control scenarios.

<br>

<h2>Assessments</h2>
The module is assessed via 100% coursework, across two elements:

<br>
<br>

<b> Set Exercises (30%) </b>
<br>
Assessment consists of implementing a `K-Means Clustering` algorithm and investigating the weaknesses of clustering algorithms.

<b> Report (70%) </b>
<br>
Assessment consists of: 1. conducting a literature review on `Supervised learning` and `Reinforcement learning`, and 2. programming, in Matlab, `neural network models` for intrusion detection in network security applications.
